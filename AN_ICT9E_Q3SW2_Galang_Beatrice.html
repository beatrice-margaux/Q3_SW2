					A guidance counsellor's special talents help her unravel the mystery behind the unexpected and gruesome death of a student at a Catholic school for girls.</p>
					<p class="review">RATING:</p>
					<p class="insights"> 
					10/10 - The movie was spectacular. Its plot and the stories of each character were so well-written. It was scary--as promised--but what the characters were going through gave an emotional mix to to. Great production and great acting.

					<p class="review">RATING:</p>
					<p class="insights">
					9/10 - This movie's plot was amazing. The storyline is great, but I do think that the movie ended in a blur. Other than that issue, the acting, the story, and the production was spectacular. I would pay to watch this movie for the first time again.

					<h5> Clarita</h5>
					<p>Directed by Roderick Cabrido</p> 
					<p class="date">Realeased on June 12, 2019</p>
					<p class="synopsis">A young woman, Clarita Villanueva, is held against her will when police suspect she has been possessed by a demon. Perhaps, multiple of them.</p>
					<p class="review">RATING:</p>
					<p class="insights">
					9.5/10 - The movie, the acting, everything was amazing. I admire how they did not focus the entire story on Clarita. The priests had their stories, the nun had her story. It's a great way to reenact what happened to Clarita Villanueva.
